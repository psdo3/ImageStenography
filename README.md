ImageStenography

Description

A program that allows the user to encode a message into an image by corverting every character of the message into their binary form and adjust the RGB value of the image according to the binary value. You can also decode the image by doing the reverse and obtain your message. The image and all its information will be store in a MySQL Database. A basic website was also created to allow an easier access to the program using localhost.
