# **ImageStenography**

## Description

A program that allows the user to encode a message into an image by corverting every character of the message into their binary form and adjust the RGB value of the image according to the binary value. You can also decode the image by doing the reverse and obtain your message. The image and all its information will be store in a MySQL Database. A basic website was also created to allow an easier access to the program using localhost. This program is still in BETA and work will continue once I have finish my main discord bot project. Encryption and Decryption currently does not work properly.

## Features

- Encode a message into an image
- Decode an image to get the hidden message
- Store image and message into into MySQL Database
- Access localhost website that is set up using FLASK

## Installation

You will need to use pip install for several modules
To be able to use encryption you will need to install pycryptodome (NOTE this is not complete and will do nothing)
To be able to use FLASK you will need to follow the [installation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/installation/) on their main website

## Support

Please send me an email at phudo15@yahoo.com for any tips and recommendations to improve the bot

## Roadmap

- Allow the user to encrypt their image with AES encryption
- Allow the user to decrypt their image with AES decryption
- More to come.
